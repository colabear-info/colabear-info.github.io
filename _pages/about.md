I'm a applied researcher at eBay now. Before thie, I get my Ph.D. degree from Duke University in Computer Engineering and becholar degree from Tsinghua University in Physics. My expertise focuses on generative models, reinforcement learning and their interactions. My proficiency in generative models includes image and text generation utilizing models like retrieval-augmented generation, GAN and VAE. In the area of RL, I focused on the exploration strategies particularly through energy-based unnormalized sampling techniques.
